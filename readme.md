### CORE
SQLAlchemy Core is the foundational architecture for SQLAlchemy as a “database toolkit”. The library provides tools for managing connectivity to a database, interacting with database queries and results, and programmatic construction of SQL statements.
### ORM
SQLAlchemy ORM builds upon the Core to provide optional object relational mapping capabilities. The ORM provides an additional configuration layer allowing user-defined Python classes to be mapped to database tables and other constructs, as well as an object persistence mechanism known as the Session. It then extends the Core-level SQL Expression Language to allow SQL queries to be composed and invoked in terms of user-defined objects.
